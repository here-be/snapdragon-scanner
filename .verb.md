## What is this?

This is a simple Lexical Scanner that takes an object of regex patterns, and uses those patterns to process an input string into an array of tokens.

**What is the difference between this and [snapdragon-lexer][]?**

snapdragon-lexer uses registered _handler functions_ to capture and handle tokens, snapdragon-scanner simply iterates over an object of regular expression patterns to create tokens. You can think of snapdragon-scanner as the "lite" version of snapdragon-lexer.

## Usage

```js
const Scanner = require('{%= name %}');
```

## API
{%= apidocs("index.js") %}

## Token objects

Scanner tokens are plain JavaScript objects with the following properties:

```js
{
  type: String;
  value: String
  match: Array
}
```

### Token properties

- `type` **{String}** - The name of the regex that matched the substring.
- `value` **{String}** - The substring that was captured by the regex.
- `match` **{Array}** - The match array from [RegExp.exec()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp/exec)
